## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- DOM
- Javascript Modules
- Factory Functions

### What I learned

Grid System: The code demonstrates the effective use of CSS Grid to create a responsive layout for the card components. The <body> uses display grid to position the <header>, <picture>, <main>, and <footer> on the screen.

Responsiveness: The code demonstrates a responsive design approach using media queries. By defining different styles for different screen sizes, the layout adapts to varying viewport widths.

Javascript Modules: The JS files of this project were divided into modules seeking to follow good practices of clean code through factory functions with cooerent names about their functionality.

E-mail Validation in JS: In this project, regular expressions were used to validate the use of e-mail.


### Useful resources

- [Project Structure](https://youtu.be/B2WL6KkqhLQ) - This helped me with Project planning, flex-box, grid container, responsiveness and css variables. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Box Shadow Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me get a preview of the shadows I would use on the components.
- [Screen Only Clas (.'sr-only')](https://kittygiraudel.com/snippets/sr-only-class/) - I used the css rules indicated in this article to ensure accessibility on the site
